From the front-end if we want to get/fetch any data, or delete any data or edit data of databse. But The database is handel by server(Backend Language -> java,c++ etc).

To get the database data, we have to call server from Frontend.
So Actually From the Frontend we want to sent request(Like GET,POST,UPDATE,DELETE) to the Server to access data. So we need a "API" link to sent those request to server.

In Server the API is created to make the connection/relation between Frontend & Backend.

So, API is a kind of Llink url through which we can create a conection between Frontend & Server and sent request(Like GET,POST,UPDATE,DELETE) to the Server.

To make those HTTP request(Like GET,POST,UPDATE,DELETE), we need an API.
From Forntend using javascript, we can call API and sent those HTTP request(Like GET,POST,UPDATE,DELETE) to server.

\*There are mainly 4 Process to calling API:

1.  XMLHttp Request
2.  Fetch API
3.  axios <- javascript Libarey
4.  Jquery
